# Trie Data Structure Implementation

## Introduction

This program focuses on implementing a trie data structure in C. Tries are tree-like structures used for efficient storage and retrieval of strings, making them ideal for tasks such as autocomplete and spell checking. In this project, each node in the trie represents a character, and the path from the root to any leaf can represent a complete word.

## Objectives

- Understand and implement tries in C.
- Work with pointers, structs, and dynamic memory allocation.
- Build and manipulate a complex data structure following good programming practices.

## Structure Description

Each node in the trie has:
- `data`: The character stored by the node. The root node contains the special character `$`.
- `word`: Points to a string if the node represents the end of a word; otherwise, it's `NULL`.
- `children`: An array of 26 pointers corresponding to each letter of the alphabet.

The trie supports operations such as insertion of words and searching for words or prefixes.
